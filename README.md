## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive threat hunting guides tailored for specific industry verticals. Each guide leverages the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to practical hunting methodologies.

These guides are designed to help security teams implement effective threat hunting programs with industry-specific focus, addressing the unique threats and environments of each sector.

## Repository Contents

The repository currently includes threat hunting guides for the following sectors:

| Sector | Description | Key Focus Areas |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To effectively use these hunting guides, security teams should have:

- A security information and event management (SIEM) system
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities
- Network monitoring tools
- Log collection from critical systems
- Basic familiarity with the MITRE ATT&CK framework

### Implementation Approach

1. Begin by reviewing the guide specific to your industry
2. Identify and prioritize the threat actors most relevant to your organization
3. Assess your current detection capabilities against the recommended hunt methodologies
4. Implement the technical hunting queries most applicable to your environment
5. Establish a regular cadence for executing these hunt operations
6. Document findings and evolve your hunting program based on results

## Customization

These guides are designed as starting points and should be customized to your specific environment:

- Adjust detection thresholds based on your baseline
- Modify queries to match your specific technology stack
- Prioritize hunts based on your organization's risk assessment
- Supplement with threat intelligence specific to your organization
